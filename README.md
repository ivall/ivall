On my GitHub profile, you will mainly find old, archived projects. Most of the projects I am currently working on are closed source (with some small exceptions). 

I am self-employed, working on my own hosting service (https://ivhost.pl), an e-commerce SaaS app for game servers (https://vishop.pl), and many other projects.
